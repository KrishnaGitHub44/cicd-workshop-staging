## Assignment 1: Committing

#### 1.1 Git Flow

First we will **fork** and **clone** the repository and create a couple of branches to facilitate a specific git workflow.

Use the command line where possible.
1.  From the GitHub interface fork the workshop repository to your own account.
2.  Clone your personal repository to your local machine
3.  Create a `develop` branch in your repository based on `main`.
4.  Push the branch back to GitHub.

We are first going to facilitate our desired Git Flow. Refer to `âš™ Settings > General > Default Branch` of your personal GitHub repository for setting the default branches.

4.  Mark branch `develop` as the default branch in your repository.
5.  Work from branch `develop` from now on in your local environment.
